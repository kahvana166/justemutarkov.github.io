	    			<h3>Fully Offline !</h3>
	    			<p>EmuTarkov emulates the official Escape From Tarkov by providing an offline server that 'communicates' with the game client as if it is online. EmuTarkov does not in any way support LAN gameplay. This is strictly a single player PVE experience.</p>

	    			<h3>Player progression !</h3>
	    			<p>EmuTarkov saves offline raid progression. Players do not have to worry about losing their fully loaded Tri-Zip and whole heap of experience gained from mowing down scavs in Customs or Interchange after successfully extracting. Oh, don't forget, your health condition, hydration and energy persists after exiting a raid. So do not forget to drink a bottle of water and finishing up an MRE before going to the next raid. Don't let hunger stops you from being a zero to a hero.</p>

	    			<h3>Mod support !</h3>
	    			<p>Let's say you are a visionary. You think that an MPX should be able to shoot.50cal bullets, an IFAK should restore 1000 hit points, or maybe you think gun should have your favorite anime character skin. Well, good news for you. EmuTarkov is fully mod-able and you can make any type of bullets to match any type of weapons, make medkits that heals 1000 hit points, or modify item skins to match your preference.</p>
